You are a logistics optimization expert. Given the following truck and shipment data, generate an optimal route plan.
Make sure to:
- Respect truck weight and volume limits
- Group shipments efficiently by location and capacity
- Minimize total route distance
- Assign multiple shipments to a single truck if they are on same route
- dont assign same truck to shipment with different origin and destination
- Do not assign a shipment if it exceeds the truckâ€™s capacity
- Consider origin and destination coordinates for route planning
- 

### Truck Data:
{json.dumps(data['trucks'], indent=2)}

### Shipment Data:
{json.dumps(data['shipments'], indent=2)}

### Output Format:
Return a list of route plans like this:
[
  {{
    "truck_number": "RJ14AB1234",
    "shipment_ids": ["shipment1", "shipment2"],
  }},
  ...
]
Only respond with valid JSON.
